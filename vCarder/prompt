You are an expert BeeWare/Toga UI developer with a strong eye for modern, sleek cross-platform designs.

Goal: Build only the frontend for a desktop/mobile app called vCarder (no business logic).

Overall Layout

    Main window title: “vCarder”

    Menu bar with two menus:

        File → “Open Source File…” (file chooser for .csv, .xlsx, .ods), “Exit”

        Contact → “Email” “Phone” “Github” “Instagram” (hyperlinks)

        Help → “About vCarder”

        Provide a “Report!” button to report for any issues just ask email(validate this email) and their issue.

    Footer bar at the bottom showing app version (e.g. “vCarder v0.1”) “Email” “Phone” “Github” “Instagram” (hyperlinks) and a copyright info.

Primary Content Area (stacked vertically):

    File Chooser

        A button labeled “Choose Source File”

        Opens a file dialog filtered to .csv, .xlsx, .ods

    Data Preview Table (shows after the file is choosen)

        Scrollable table (Toga Table in a ScrollContainer with a fixed height after that scrollable for width also same)

        Populate with a dummy Python dict.

    Field Mapping Section

        Label: “Field Mapping”

        Rows for each main parameter, each with:

            Static label (e.g. “First Name”) → Dropdown listing all table columns, excluding any columns already mapped in earlier dropdowns or additional fields.


        Order of fields:

            First Name

            Last Name

            Full Name

            Phone

            Address

            Email

    Additional Fields Section

        Label: “Additional”

        A single Dropdown listing optional fields: “Additional Phone Number”, “Organization”, “Title”, “URL”, “Birthday”

        Show them just like above, with the same exclusion logic (any column selected anywhere(including selected in forementioned feild) is removed from all future dropdowns).

        

    Action Button

         “Get vCard” button (for now just print btn back pressed).

Dynamic Exclusion Rule

    Once a column is selected in any dropdown, it must no longer appear as an option in any subsequent dropdowns (both main and additional).

    This ensures each vCard field maps to a unique source column.

Styling & Behavior

    Light/dark theme support (or prepare for it)

    Consistent padding (12px+) and typography (title 20pt, headers 14–16pt)

    All code in a single app.py, with a VCarderApp (or MainWindow) class building the UI in startup().

Output Requirements

    Full app.py with imports, app class, and app.main_loop().

    Stub callbacks for file chooser, dropdown updates, and “Get vCard.”

    Inline comments for each major widget/layout.

    README snippet at top explaining how to run the app.

Step-by-Step Generation

    Step 1: Scaffold main window & menu bar

    Step 2: Add file chooser widget

    Step 3: Populate dummy data table

    Step 4: Create Field Mapping with dynamic exclusion

    Step 5: Implement Additional Fields section

    Step 6: Add “Get vCard” button & footer

    Step 7: Polish styling

Tone & Style

    Follow PEP 8, include docstrings

    Use concise, descriptive comments

    Wrap Toga snippets in Markdown code fences
